This is a game I built, following a tutorial to learn more C# and how to translate what I was learning into Unity functionality.

Move with WASD, attack with space. Gather gold from chests, then click the chest icon in the bottom-left to bring up your menu, where you can upgrade your sword and see how far you are from the next level. At the bottom-right of level 2, there's a healing fountain and a hole that will drop you back down to the original spawn point.
