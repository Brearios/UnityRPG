This is a game I built, following a tutorial to get more familiar with C# and learn to use it in Unity.

Move with WASD, attack with space. Gather gold from chests, then click the chest icon in the bottom-left to bring up your menu, where you can upgrade your sword and see how far you are from the next level. At the bottom-right of level 2, there's a healing fountain and a hole that will drop you back down to the original spawn point.

Download the Build folder, and you can run "Real Time RPG" to play it, or download the Source folder, and you can look in Assets/Scripts to see the code.
